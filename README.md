# Italy Travel Planner

## This is a traval planner for people who want to visit Italy and plan/blog their trip and time there.

## Description:

- This projects goal is to assist user in planning out their lavish vacations to the beautiful country of Italy. When our personal vacaations we found it cumbersome to keep track of every little detail. That is why we decide to develop this website! 
- This project puts a blog, budget, and city list on the same page to prevent users from having to use multiple webpages/planners. 
- While creating this site. We were exposed to the practical applications of the various features in HTML, CSS, Javascript. As a group, we got more comfortable with the logic behind these compontents and how they interact with each other.
